          <p>
            After working with graphic design for about ten years, I decided to change my career to
            something more challenging. I just graduated from an intensive Full Stack Web
            Development bootcamp and now I'm looking forward to putting all this new knowledge in
            practice combined with my design skills. Iâ€™m looking for an opportunity in the tech
            industry where I can continue learning, collaborating, creating and developing new great
            innovative solutions for the world.{' '}
